//! A data structure that represents a sorted set of dates.
//!
//! It uses a `BTreeSet` internally to store the dates, which guarantees that the dates are always sorted.
//! This is useful for scenarios where you need to iterate over the dates in a specific order or perform range queries.
//!
//! The `MultiDate` struct provides methods for adding, removing, and checking the existence of dates in the set.
//! It also supports operations like finding the minimum and maximum dates, as well as iterating over the dates in the set.
