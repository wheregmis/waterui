//! This module provides mechanisms for extracting values from the Environment.
//!
//! It defines the `Extractor` trait for types that can be extracted from an
//! Environment, along with implementations for common types.
//! The `Use<T>` wrapper provides a convenient way to extract specific types
//! from the environment.
