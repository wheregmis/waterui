//! # View Module
//!
//! This module provides the core abstractions for building user interfaces.
//!
//! The primary types include:
//! - `View`: The fundamental trait for UI components
//! - `IntoView`: A trait for converting values into views
//! - `TupleViews`: A trait for working with collections of views
//! - `ConfigurableView`: A trait for views that can be configured
//! - `Modifier`: A type for modifying configurable views
//!
//! These abstractions support a declarative and composable approach to UI building, allowing
//! for flexible combinations of views and transformations.

use crate::{AnyView, Environment, components::Metadata};
use alloc::{boxed::Box, vec::Vec};

/// View represents a part of the user interface.
///
/// You can create your custom view by implementing this trait. You just need to implement fit.
///
/// Users can also create a View using a function that returns another View. This allows for more
/// flexible and composable UI designs.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// use waterui_core::View;
///
/// fn greeting() -> impl View {
///     "Hello, World!" // &'static str implements View
/// }
///
#[must_use]
